# Dogflight!
A web-based multiplayer game that simulates arcade-style aerial dogfighting.



## Installation


 * Install **[git](https://git-scm.com/)** and **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**. Ensure that both **`git`** and **`npm`** can access remote repositories (this should just work fine, but additional configuration may be necessary if web content can only be accessed via a web proxy)
 * Clone a copy of Dogflight!: **`git clone https://github.com/maikmerten/dogflight.git`**
 * Enter the directory with the Dogflight! clone: **`cd dogflight`**
 * Ensure that all dependencies are installed: **`npm install`**
 * Start the Dogflight! server: **`node server`**
